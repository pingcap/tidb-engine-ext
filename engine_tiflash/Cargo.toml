# Disables runtime checks of invariants required by RocksDB that are redundant
# with assertions inside RocksDB itself. This makes it possible to test those
# invariants in Rust tests, resulting an a panic instead of an abort, at the
# expense of an extra branch. This feature exists to mark those extra branches.
# The checks _can_ be disabled by enabling this feature, though it may not
# result in any real performance improvement to do so, and it will break
# the test suite.
#
# Probably these checks should be in the rust-rocksdb crate itself, in order
# to ensure the bindings are safe, but until that is done, they are here.
